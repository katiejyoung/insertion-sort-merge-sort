# Insertion Sort and Merge Sort
Implement merge sort and insertion sort to sort an array/vector of integers.  Name your programs “mergesort” and “insertsort”.  Both programs should read inputs from a file called “data.txt” where the first value of each line is the number of integers that need to be sorted, followed by the integers.
